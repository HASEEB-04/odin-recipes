        <p> Sweet potato turkey meatloaf is a savory and comforting dish that combines lean ground turkey with the natural sweetness and creamy texture of sweet potatoes. The meatloaf is made with ground turkey, which is mixed with finely chopped onions,
            <br>garlic, and a blend of herbs and spices. Mashed sweet potatoes are incorporated into the mixture, adding moisture and a subtle sweetness that contrasts beautifully with the savory turkey. Often, an egg and some
            <br>breadcrumbs or oats are added to help bind the ingredients together and ensure a tender texture.The mixture is formed into a loaf shape and baked until itâ€™s cooked through and golden brown on the outside.
