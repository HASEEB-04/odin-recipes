    <p> Lasagna is a classic Italian dish featuring layers of wide, flat pasta sheets stacked with rich fillings. Typically, these layers include a savory meat sauce made with ground beef or sausage,
    <br> a creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese mixture, and a generous topping of melted mozzarella or Parmesan cheese. Baked until bubbling and golden, lasagna offers a comforting blend of flavors and textures in every bite.</p>
    <p>Lasagna often starts with a base of meat sauce, which is slow-cooked with tomatoes, onions, garlic, and herbs, creating a deep, flavorful foundation. The cheese layer, whether it's a smooth
    <br> ricotta blend or a béchamel sauce, adds a creamy richness that contrasts beautifully with the savory sauce. As it bakes, the pasta absorbs flavors and becomes tender, while the top layer of cheese forms a golden, crispy crust.
    <br> Each serving delivers a satisfying combination of hearty meat, velvety cheese, and tender pasta, making lasagna a beloved comfort food around the world.</p>
