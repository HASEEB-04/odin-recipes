    <p> Chicken salad is a versatile dish made with cooked, diced chicken mixed with various ingredients like crisp vegetables, fruits, nuts, and a creamy dressing or mayonnaise. Often served chilled, it can be enjoyed on its own
    <br>  in a sandwich, or over a bed of greens. The combination of tender chicken with crunchy or sweet elements creates a refreshing and satisfying meal.</p>
    <p> Chicken salad typically starts with tender, cooked chicken—whether poached, grilled, or roasted—cut into bite-sized pieces. This is combined with ingredients such as celery, apples, grapes, or nuts, adding a range of textures and flavors.
    <br>  The mixture is then bound together with a dressing, usually made from mayonnaise, yogurt, or a vinaigrette, providing creaminess and tang. Often seasoned with herbs and spices,
    <br> chicken salad can be customized with additional ingredients like avocado or cheese.</p>
